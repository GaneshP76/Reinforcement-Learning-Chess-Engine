also what about the storage of data is stores if i want to execute in different pc will i need to transfer all the storage  
it does to perform optimally because i dont want to train every singlt time i wanna play from different pc. also there is the issue where i wanna develop it into app.
and play on mobile so storage will be the issue. what is the solutions to this?

also as im seeint the training as it happes and logs in terminals it only promote to knight, bishop, rook. 
i ahve not seen queen promotion untill now at 400 episodes . even at 600 episodes.  Also Evaluation vs Random: 11.0% win rate (11W-81D-8L).
even at 800 no promotion to queen also Evaluation vs Random: 5.0% win rate (5W-88D-7L) from 11
also data storage increased ti 500MB
is it traeting the promotion as necessary to win the game ? 1000 episodes


also while playing as black i cant move any pice after ai does its first move. 



new}  default draw?

where is promotion msg?
what is decreased difficulty?



also i what implanning is the ai to self evolve even after the traing it does. like if it found new moves from a human oppnents if it playes against it learns also learns to counter it. 
Also i want ti be trained comprehensively in most of the playes and learn from most of the GM. reach the superhuman ratings. i want it to be strongest AI to beat for any human players.
